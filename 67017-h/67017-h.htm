<p class='c004'>⁂ This Tract contains no more than the author has found, from
experience, to be much wanted by students who are commencing
with Euclid. It will ultimately form an Appendix to his Treatise on
Arithmetic.</p>

<p class='c005'>The author would not, by any means, in presenting the minimum
necessary for a particular purpose, be held to imply that he has given
enough of the subject for all the ends of education. He has long regretted
the neglect of logic; a science, the study of which would shew
many of its opponents that the light esteem in which they hold it arises
from those habits of inference which thrive best in its absence. He
strongly recommends any student to whom this tract may be the first
introduction of the subject, to pursue it to a much greater extent.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>What we here mean by Logic is the examination of that part of
reasoning which depends upon the manner in which inferences are
formed, and the investigation of general maxims and rules for constructing
arguments, so that the conclusion may contain no inaccuracy
which was not previously asserted in the premises. It has nothing to
do with the truth of the facts, opinions, or presumptions, from which an
inference is derived; but simply takes care that the inference shall
certainly be true, if the premises be true. Thus, when we say that all
men will die, and that all men are rational beings, and thence infer that
some rational beings will die, the <em>logical</em> truth of this sentence is the
same whether it be true or false that men are mortal and rational. This
logical truth depends upon the structure of the sentence, and not on the
particular matters spoken of. Thus,</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c008'>Instead of,</td>
    <td class='c009'>Write,</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c008'>All men will die.</td>
    <td class='c009'>Every A is B.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c008'>All men are rational beings.</td>
    <td class='c009'>Every A is C.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c008'>Therefore some rational beings will die.</td>
    <td class='c009'>Therefore some Cs are Bs.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>The second of these is the same proposition, logically considered, as the
first; the consequence in both is virtually contained in, and rightly
inferred from, the premises. Whether the premises be true or false, is
not a question of logic, but of morals, philosophy, history, or any other
knowledge to which their subject-matter belongs: the question of logic
is, does the conclusion certainly follow if the premises be true?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Every act of reasoning must mainly consist in comparing together
different things, and either finding out, or recalling from previous
knowledge, the points in which they resemble or differ from each other.
That particular part of reasoning which is called <em>inference</em>, consists in
the comparison of several and different things with one and the same
other thing; and ascertaining the resemblances, or differences, of the
several things, by means of the points in which they resemble, or differ
from, the thing with which all are compared.</p>

<p class='c005'>There must then be some propositions already obtained before any
inference can be drawn. All propositions are either assertions or denials,
and are thus divided into <em>affirmative</em> and <em>negative</em>. Thus, A is B, and
A is not B, are the two forms to which all propositions may be reduced.
These are, for our present purpose, the most simple forms; though it
will frequently happen that much circumlocution is needed to reduce
propositions to them. Thus, suppose the following assertion, ‘If he
should come to-morrow, he will probably stay till Monday’; how is
this to be reduced to the form A is B? There is evidently something
spoken of, something said of it, and an affirmative connexion between
them. Something, if it happen, that is, the happening of something,
makes the happening of another something probable; or is one of the
things which render the happening of the second thing probable.</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
 <td class='brt c011'>A</td>
 <td class='brt c011'>is</td>
    <td class='c011'>B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c012' colspan='3'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
 <td class='brt c012'>The happening of his arrival to-morrow</td>
 <td class='brt c011'>is</td>
    <td class='c012'>an event from which it may be inferred as probable that he will stay till Monday.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c005'>The forms of language will allow the manner of asserting to be varied
in a great number of ways; but the reduction to the preceding form
is always possible. Thus, ‘so he said’ is an affirmation, reducible
as follows:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
 <td class='brt c012'>What you have just said (or whatever else ‘so’ refers to)</td>
 <td class='brt c011'>is</td>
    <td class='c012'>the thing which he said.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c005'>By changing ‘is’ into ‘is not,’ we make a negative proposition;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>but care must always be taken to ascertain whether a proposition
which appears negative is really so. The principal danger is that of
confounding a proposition which is negative with another which is
affirmative of something requiring a negative to describe it. Thus
‘he resembles the man who was not in the room,’ is affirmative, and
must not be confounded with ‘he does not resemble the man who was
in the room.’ Again, ‘if he should come to-morrow, it is probable he
will not stay till Monday,’ does not mean the simple denial of the preceding
proposition, but the affirmation of the directly opposite proposition.
It is,</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
 <td class='brt c011'>A</td>
 <td class='brt c011'>is</td>
    <td class='c011'>B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c012' colspan='3'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
 <td class='brt c012'>The happening of his arrival to-morrow,</td>
 <td class='brt c011'>is</td>
    <td class='c012'>an event from which it may be inferred to be <em>im</em>probable that he will stay till Monday,</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>whereas the following,</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
 <td class='brt c012'>The happening of his arrival to-morrow,</td>
 <td class='brt c011'>is <em>not</em></td>
    <td class='c012'>an event from which it may be inferred as probable that he will stay till Monday,</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c010'>would be expressed thus: ‘If he should come to-morrow, that is no
reason why he should stay till Monday.’</p>

<p class='c005'>Moreover, the negative words not, no, &amp;c., have two kinds of meaning
which must be carefully distinguished. Sometimes they deny, and
nothing more: sometimes they are used to affirm the direct contrary.
In cases which offer but two alternatives, one of which is necessary,
these amount to the same thing, since the denial of one, and the affirmation
of the other, are obviously equivalent propositions. In many
idioms of conversation, the negative implies affirmation of the contrary
in cases which offer not only alternatives, but degrees of alternatives.
Thus, to the question, ‘Is he tall?’ the simple answer, ‘No,’ most
frequently means that he is the contrary of tall, or considerably under
the average. But it must be remembered, that, in all logical reasoning,
the negation is simply negation, and nothing more, never implying
affirmation of the contrary.</p>

<p class='c005'>The common proposition that two negatives make an affirmative, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>true only upon the supposition that there are but two possible things,
one of which is denied. Grant that a man must be either able or unable
to do a particular thing, and then <em>not unable</em> and able are the same
things. But if we suppose various degrees of performance, and therefore
degrees of ability, it is false, in the common sense of the words,
that two negatives make an affirmative. Thus, it would be erroneous
to say, ‘John is able to translate Virgil, and Thomas is not unable;
therefore, what John can do Thomas can do,’ for it is evident that the
premises mean that John is so near to the best sort of translation
that an affirmation of his ability may be made, while Thomas is considerably
lower than John, but not so near to absolute deficiency that
his ability may be altogether denied. It will generally be found that
two negatives imply an affirmative of a weaker degree than the positive
affirmation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Each of the propositions, ‘A is B,’ and ‘A is not B,’ may be subdivided
into two species: the <em>universal</em>, in which every possible case is
included; and the <em>particular</em>, in which it is not meant to be asserted
that the affirmation or negation is universal. The four species of propositions
are then as follows, each being marked with the letter by
which writers on logic have always distinguished it.</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>A <em>Universal Affirmative</em></td>
    <td class='c013'>Every A is</td>
    <td class='c014'>B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>E <em>Universal Negative</em></td>
    <td class='c013'>No A is</td>
    <td class='c014'>B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>I <em>Particular Affirmative</em></td>
    <td class='c013'>Some A is</td>
    <td class='c014'>B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>O <em>Particular Negative</em></td>
    <td class='c013'>Some A is not</td>
    <td class='c014'>B</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c005'>In common conversation the affirmation of a part is meant to imply
the denial of the remainder. Thus, by ‘some of the apples are ripe,’
it is always intended to signify that some are not ripe. This is not the
case in logical language, but every proposition is intended to make its
amount of affirmation or denial, and no more. When we say, ‘Some
A is B,’ or, more grammatically, ‘Some As are Bs,’ we do not mean to
imply that some are not: this may or may not be. Again, the word
some means, ‘one or more, possibly all.’ The following table will shew
the bearing of each proposition on the rest.</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr><td class='c015' colspan='2'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span></td></tr>
  <tr>
 <td class='brt c012'><em>Every A is B</em> affirms and contains <em>Some A is B</em> and denies</td>
    <td class='c016'><em>No A is B</em><br /><em>Some A is not B</em></td>

  <tr>
 <td class='brt c012'><em>No A is B</em> affirms and contains <em>Some A is not B</em> and denies</td>

<p class='c010'>A contrary, therefore, is a complete and total contradictory; and a little
consideration will make it appear that the decisive distinction between
contraries and contradictories lies in this, that contraries may both be
false, but of contradictories, one must be true and the other false. We
may say, ‘Either P is true, or <em>something</em> in contradiction of it is true;’
but we cannot say, ‘Either P is true, or <em>every thing</em> in contradiction of
it is true.’ It is a very common mistake to imagine that the <em>denial</em> of a
proposition gives a right to <em>affirm</em> the contrary; whereas it should be,
that the <em>affirmation</em> of a proposition gives a right to <em>deny</em> the contrary.
Thus, if we deny that Every A is B, we do not affirm that No A is B,
but only that Some A is not B; while, if we affirm that Every A is B,
we deny No A is B, and also Some A is not B.</p>

<p class='c005'>But, as to contradictories, affirmation of one is a denial of the other,
and denial of one is affirmation of the other. Thus, either Every A
is B, or Some A is not B: affirmation of either is denial of the other,
and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vice versá</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Let the student now endeavour to satisfy himself of the following.
Taking the four preceding propositions, A, E, I, O, let the simple letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>signify the affirmation, the same letter in parentheses the denial, and
the absence of the letter, that there is neither affirmation nor denial.</p>

<p class='c010'>These may be thus summed up: The affirmation of a universal proposition,
and the denial of a particular one, enable us to affirm or deny
all the other three; but the denial of a universal proposition, and the
affirmation of a particular one, leave us unable to affirm or deny two
of the others.</p>

<p class='c005'>In such propositions as ‘Every A is B,’ ‘Some A is not B,’ &amp;c.,
A is called the <em>subject</em>, and B the <em>predicate</em>, while the verb ‘is’ or
‘is not,’ is called the <em>copula</em>. It is obvious that the words of the
proposition point out whether the subject is spoken of universally or
partially, but not so of the predicate, which it is therefore important to
examine. Logical writers generally give the name of <em>distributed</em> subjects
or predicates to those which are spoken of universally; but as this
word is rather technical, I shall say that a subject or predicate enters
wholly or partially, according as it is universally or particularly spoken of.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. In A, or ‘Every A is B,’ the subject enters wholly, but the
predicate only partially. For it obviously says, ‘Among the Bs are
all the As,’ ‘Every A is part of the collection of Bs, so that all the As
make a part of the Bs, the whole it <em>may</em> be.’ Thus, ‘Every horse is
an animal,’ does not speak of all animals, but states that all the horses
make up a portion of the animals.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. In E, or ‘No A is B,’ both subject and predicate enter wholly.
‘No A whatsoever is any one out of all the Bs;’ ‘search the whole
collection of Bs, and <em>every</em> B shall be found to be something which is
not A.’</p>

<p class='c005'>3. In I, or ‘Some A is B,’ both subject and predicate enter partially.
‘Some of the As are found among the Bs, or make up a part (the
whole possibly, but not known from the preceding) of the Bs.’</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>4. In O, or ‘Some A is not B,’ the subject enters partially, and the
predicate wholly. ‘Some As are none of them any whatsoever of the
Bs; every B will be found to be no one out of a certain portion of
the As.’</p>

<p class='c005'>It appears then that,</p>

<p class='c005'>In affirmatives, the predicate enters partially.</p>

<p class='c005'>In negatives, the predicate enters wholly.</p>

<p class='c005'>In contradictory propositions, both subject and predicate enter
differently in the two.</p>

<p class='c005'>The <em>converse</em> of a proposition is that which is made by interchanging
the subject and predicate, as follows:</p>

<table class='table0' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <th class='c008'>The proposition.</th>
    <th class='c009'>Its converse.</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>A Every A is B</td>
    <td class='c014'>Every B is A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>E No A is B</td>
    <td class='c014'>No B is A</td>

    <td class='c014'>Some B is A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c021'>O Some A is not B</td>
    <td class='c014'>Some B is not A</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c005'>Now, it is a fundamental and self-evident proposition, that no consequence
must be allowed to assert more widely than its premises; so
that, for instance, an assertion which is only of some Bs can never
lead to a result which is true of all Bs. But if a proposition assert
agreement or disagreement, any other proposition which asserts the
same, to the same extent and no further, must be a legitimate consequence;
or, if you please, must amount to the whole, or part, of the
original assertion in another form. Thus, the converse of A is not
true: for, in ‘Every A is B,’ the predicate enters partially; while in
‘Every B is A,’ the subject enters wholly. ‘All the As make up a
part of the Bs, then a part of the Bs are among the As, or some B is
A.’ Hence, the only <em>legitimate</em> converse of ‘Every A is B’ is, ‘Some
B is A.’ But in ‘No A is B,’ both subject and predicate enter wholly,
and ‘No B is A’ is, in fact, the same proposition as ‘No A is B.’ And
‘Some A is B’ is also the same as its converse ‘Some B is A;’ here
both terms enter partially. But ‘Some A is not B’ admits of no
converse whatever; it is perfectly consistent with all assertions upon B
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and A in which B is the subject. Thus neither of the four following
lines is inconsistent with itself.</p>

<p class='c005'>Having thus discussed the principal points connected with the simple
assertion, we pass to the manner of making two assertions give a third.
Every instance of this is called a syllogism, the two assertions which
form the basis of the third are called premises, and the third itself the
conclusion.</p>

<p class='c005'>If two things both agree with a third in any particular, they agree
with each other in the same; as, if A be of the same colour as X, and
B of the same colour as X, then A is of the same colour as B. Again,
if A differ from X in any particular in which B agrees with X, then
A and B differ in that particular. If A be not of the same colour as X,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and B be of the same colour as X, then A is not of the colour of B.
But if A and B both differ from X in any particular, nothing can be
inferred; they may either differ in the same way and to the same
extent, or not. Thus, if A and B be both of different colours from X,
it neither follows that they agree, nor differ, in their own colours.</p>

<p class='c005'>The paragraph preceding contains the essential parts of all inference,
which consists in comparing two things with a third, and finding from
their agreement or difference with that third, their agreement or difference
with one another. Thus, Every A is X, every B is X, allows us
to infer that A and B have all those qualities in common which are
necessary to X. Again, from Every A is X, and ‘No B is X,’ we
infer that A and B differ from one another in all particulars which
are essential to X. The preceding forms, however, though they represent
common reasoning better than the ordinary syllogism, to which we
are now coming, do not constitute the ultimate forms of inference.
Simple <em>identity</em> or <em>non-identity</em> is the ultimate state to which every
assertion may be reduced; and we shall, therefore, first ask, from what
identities, &amp;c., can other identities, &amp;c., be produced? Again, since we
name objects in species, each species consisting of a number of individuals,
and since our assertion may include all or only part of a species,
it is further necessary to ask, in every instance, to what extent the
conclusion drawn is true, whether of all, or only of part?</p>

<p class='c005'>Let us take the simple assertion, ‘Every living man respires;’ or,
every living man is one of the things (however varied they may be)
which respire. If we were to inclose all living men in a large triangle,
and all respiring objects in a large circle, the preceding assertion, if true,
would require that the whole of the triangle should be contained in the
circle. And in the same way we may reduce any assertion to the
expression of a coincidence, total or partial, between two figures. Thus,
a point in a circle may represent an individual of one species, and a
point in a triangle an individual of another species: and we may express
that the whole of one species is asserted to be contained or not contained
in the other by such forms as, ‘All the △ is in the ○’;
‘None of the △ is in the ○’.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Any two assertions about A and B, each expressing agreement or
disagreement, total or partial, with or from X, and leading to a conclusion

<p class='c005'>But here it will appear, on a little consideration, that the conclusion
is only thus far true; that those As which are Xs cannot be <em>those</em> Bs
which are not Xs; but they may be <em>other</em> Bs, about which nothing is
asserted when we say that <em>some</em> Bs are not Xs. And further consideration
will make it evident, that a conclusion of this form can only be
arrived at when one of the figures is entirely within the circle, and
the whole or part of the other without; or else when the whole of one
of the figures is without the circle, and the whole or part of the other

forms which allow of a particular negative conclusion, in which it
should be remembered that a particular proposition in the premises
may always be changed into a universal one, without affecting the

with A and B interchanged.</p>

<p class='c005'>Before proceeding to shew that all the usual forms are contained in
the preceding, let the reader remark the following rules, which may be
proved either by collecting them from the preceding cases, or by independent
reasoning.</p>

<p class='c005'>1. The middle term must enter universally into one or the other
premiss. If it were not so, the one premiss might speak of one part
of the middle term, and the other of the other; so that there would,
in fact, be no middle term. Thus, ‘Every A is X, Every B is X,’
gives no conclusion: it may be thus stated;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All the As make up <em>a part</em> of the Xs</div>
      <div class='line'>All the Bs make up <em>a part</em> of the Xs</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>And, before we can know that there is any common term of comparison
at all, we must have some means of shewing that the two parts are the
same; or the preceding premises by themselves are inconclusive.</p>

<p class='c005'>2. No term must enter the conclusion more generally than it is
found in the premises; thus, if A be spoken of partially in the premises,
it must enter partially into the conclusion. This is obvious, since the
conclusion must assert no more than the premises imply.</p>

<p class='c005'>3. From premises both negative no conclusion can be drawn. For
it is obvious, that the mere assertion of disagreement between each of
two things and a third, can be no reason for inferring either agreement
or disagreement between these two things. It will not be difficult to
reduce any case which falls under this rule to a breach of the first rule:
thus, No A is X, No B is X, gives</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Every A is (something which is not X)</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>in which the middle term is not spoken of universally in either. Again,
‘No X is A, Some X is not B,’ may be converted into</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Every A is (a thing which is not X)</div>
      <div class='line'>Some (thing which is not B) is X</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>in which there is no middle term.</p>

<p class='c005'>4. From premises both particular no conclusion can be drawn. This
is sufficiently obvious when the first or second rule is broken, as in
‘Some A is X, Some B is X.’ But it is not immediately obvious
when the middle term enters one of the premises universally. The
following reasoning will serve for exercise in the preceding results.
Since both premises are particular in form, the middle term can only
enter one of them universally by being the predicate of a negative
proposition; consequently (Rule 3) the other premiss must be
affirmative, and, being particular, neither of its terms is universal.
Consequently both the terms as to which the conclusion is to be drawn
enter partially, and the conclusion (Rule 2) can only be a particular
<em>affirmative</em> proposition. But if one of the premises be negative, the
conclusion must be <em>negative</em> (as we shall immediately see). This contradiction
shews that the supposition of particular premises producing
a legitimate result is inadmissible.</p>

<p class='c005'>5. If one premiss be negative, the conclusion, if any, must be negative.
If one term agree with a second and disagree with a third, no
agreement can be inferred between the second and third.</p>

<p class='c005'>6. If one premiss be particular, the conclusion must be particular.
This is not very obvious, since the middle term may be universally
spoken of in a particular proposition, as in Some B is not X. But this
requires one negative proposition, whence (Rule 3) the other must
be affirmative. Again, since the conclusion must be negative (Rule 5)
its predicate is spoken of universally, and, therefore, must enter universally;
the other term A must enter, then, in a universal affirmative
proposition, which is against the supposition.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the preceding set of syllogisms we observe one form only which
produces A, or E, or I, but three which produce O.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Let an assertion be said to be weakened when it is reduced from
universal to particular, and strengthened in the contrary case. Thus,
‘Every A is B’ is called stronger than ‘Some A is B.’</p>

<p class='c005'>Every form of syllogism which can give a legitimate result is either
one of the preceding six, or another formed from one of the six, either
by changing one of the assertions into its converse, if that be allowable,
or by strengthening one of the premises without altering the conclusion,
or both. Thus,</p>

<p class='c005'>It would be possible also to form a legitimate syllogism by weakening
the conclusion, when it is universal, since that which is true of all is
true of some. Thus, ‘Every A is X, Every X is B,’ which yields
‘Every A is B,’ also yields ‘Some A is B.’ But writers on logic have
always considered these syllogisms as useless, conceiving it better to
draw from any premises their strongest conclusion. In this they were
undoubtedly right; and the only question is, whether it would not have
been advisable to make the premises as weak as possible, and not to
admit any syllogisms in which more appeared than was absolutely
necessary to the conclusion. If such had been the practice, then</p>

a partial conclusion, and which are (all but one) derived from the first

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Every assertion which can be made upon two things by comparison
with any third, that is, every simple inference, can be reduced to
one of the preceding forms. Generally speaking, one of the premises
is omitted, as obvious from the conclusion; that is, one premiss being
named and the conclusion, that premiss is implied which is necessary to
make the conclusion good. Thus, if I say, “That race must have
possessed some of the arts of life, for they came from Asia,” it is
obviously meant to be asserted, that all races coming from Asia must
have possessed some of the arts of life. The preceding is then a syllogism,
as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>‘That race’ is ‘a race of Asiatic origin:’</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Every ‘race of Asiatic origin’ is ‘a race which must have possessed some of the arts of life:’</div>
      <div class='line'>Therefore, That race <em>is</em> a race which must have possessed some of the arts of life.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>A person who makes the preceding assertion either means to
imply, antecedently to the conclusion, that all Asiatic races must
have possessed arts, or he talks nonsense if he asserts the conclusion
positively. ‘A must be B, for it is X,’ can only be true when
‘Every X is B.’ This latter proposition may be called the suppressed
premiss; and it is in such suppressed propositions that the
greatest danger of error lies. It is also in such propositions that
men convey opinions which they would not willingly express. Thus,
the honest witness who said, ‘I always thought him a respectable
man—he kept his gig,’ would probably not have admitted in direct
terms, ‘Every man who keeps a gig must be respectable.’</p>

<p class='c007'>I shall now give a few detached illustrations of what precedes.</p>

<p class='c005'>“His imbecility of character might have been inferred from his
proneness to favourites; for all weak princes have this failing.” The
preceding would stand very well in a history, and many would pass
it over as containing very good inference. Written, however, in the
form of a syllogism, it is,</p>

<p class='c010'>which is palpably wrong. (Rule 1.) The writer of such a sentence as
the preceding might have meant to say, ‘for all who have this failing
are weak princes;’ in which case he would have inferred rightly.
Every one should be aware that there is much false inference arising
out of badness of style, which is just as injurious to the habits of the
untrained reader as if the errors were mistakes of logic in the mind of
the writer.</p>

<p class='c005'>‘A is less than B; B is less than C: therefore A is less than C.’
This, at first sight, appears to be a syllogism; but, on reducing it to
the usual form, we find it to be,</p>

<p class='c010'>which is not a syllogism, since there is no middle term. Evident as the
preceding is, the following additional proposition must be formed before
it can be made explicitly logical. ‘If B be a magnitude less than C,
then every magnitude less than B is also less than C.’ There is, then,
before the preceding can be reduced to a syllogistic form, the necessity
of a deduction from the second premiss, and the substitution of the
result instead of that premiss. Thus,</p>

<p class='c010'>But, if the additional argument be examined—namely, if B be less than
C, then that which is less than B is less than C—it will be found to
require precisely the same considerations repeated; for the original
inference was nothing more. In fact, it may easily be seen as follows,
that the proposition before us involves more than any simple syllogism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>can express. When we say that A is less than B, we say that if A
were applied to B, every part of A would match a part of B, and there
would be parts of B remaining over. But when we say, ‘Every A is B,’
meaning the premiss of a common syllogism, we say that every instance
of A is an instance of B, without saying any thing as to whether there
are or are not instances of B still left, after those which are also A are
taken away. If, then, we wish to write an ordinary syllogism in a
manner which shall correspond with ‘A is less than B, B is less than
C, therefore A is less than C,’ we must introduce a more definite amount
of assertion than was made in the preceding forms. Thus,</p>

<p class='c005'>This sort of argument is called <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à fortiori</span></i> argument, because the premises
are more than sufficient to prove the conclusion, and the extent of
the conclusion is thereby greater than its mere form would indicate.
Thus, ‘A is less than B, B is less than C, therefore, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à fortiori</span></i>, A is less
than C,’ means that the extent to which A is less than C must be
greater than that to which A is less than B, or B than C. In the
syllogism last written, either of the bracketed premises might be
struck out without destroying the conclusion; which last would, however,
be weakened. As it stands, then, the part of the conclusion,
‘Some C is not A,’ follows it <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à fortiori</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The argument <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à fortiori</span></i>, may then be defined as a universally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>affirmative syllogism, in which both of the premises are shewn to be
less than the whole truth, or greater. Thus, in ‘Every A is X, Every
X is B, therefore Every A is B,’ we do not certainly imply that there
are more Xs than As, or more Bs than Xs, so that we do not know that
there are more Bs than As. But if we are at liberty to state the
syllogism as follows,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All the As make up part (and part only) of the Xs</div>
      <div class='line'>Every X is B;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>then we are certain that</p>

      <div class='line'>All the Xs make up part (and part only) of the Bs</div>

<p class='c010'>and the words in Italics mark that quality of the conclusion from which
the argument is called <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à fortiori</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Most syllogisms which give an affirmative conclusion are generally
meant to imply <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à fortiori</span></i> arguments, except only in mathematics. It
is seldom, except in the exact sciences, that we meet with a proposition,
‘Every A is B,’ which we cannot immediately couple with
‘Some Bs are not As.’</p>

<p class='c005'>When an argument is completely established, with the exception of
one assertion only, so that the inference may be drawn as soon as that
one assertion is established, the result is stated in a form which bears
the name of an <em>hypothetical</em> syllogism. The word hypothesis means
nothing but supposition; and the species of syllogism just mentioned
first lays down the assertion that a consequence will be true if a certain
condition be fulfilled, and then either asserts the fulfilment of the condition,
and thence the consequence, or else denies the consequence, and
thence denies the fulfilment of the condition. Thus, if we know that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When A is B, it follows that P is Q;</div>

P is Q; or, if we can shew that P is not Q, we know that A is not B.
But if we find that A is not B, we can infer nothing; for the preceding
does not assert that P is Q <em>only</em> when A is B. And if we find out that
P is Q, we can infer nothing. This conditional syllogism may be converted
into an ordinary syllogism, as follows. Let K be any ‘case in
which A is B,’ and Z a ‘case in which P is Q’; then the preceding
assertion amounts to ‘Every K is Z.’ Let L be a particular instance,
the A of which may or may not be B. If A be B in the instance
under discussion, or if A be not B, we have, in the one case and the
other,</p>

<p class='c010'>That is to say: The assertion of an hypothesis is the assertion of its
necessary consequence, and the denial of the necessary consequence is
the denial of the hypothesis; but the assertion of the necessary consequence
gives no right to assert the hypothesis, nor does the denial of the
hypothesis give any right to deny the truth of that which would (were
the hypothesis true) be its necessary consequence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Demonstration is of two kinds: which arises from this, that every
proposition has a contradictory; and of these two, one must be true and
the other must be false. We may then either prove a proposition to be
true, or its contradictory to be false. ‘It is true that Every A is B,’
and, ‘it is false that there are some As which are not Bs,’ are the same
proposition; and the proof of either is called the indirect proof of the
other.</p>

<p class='c005'>But how is any proposition to be proved false, except by proving a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>contradiction to be true? By proving a necessary consequence of the
proposition to be false. But this is not a complete answer, since it
involves the necessity of doing the same thing; or, so far as this answer
goes, one proposition cannot be proved false unless by proving another to
be false. But it may happen, that a necessary consequence can be
obtained which is obviously and self-evidently false, in which case no
further proof of the falsehood of the hypothesis is necessary. Thus the
proof which Euclid gives that all equiangular triangles are equilateral
is of the following structure, logically considered.</p>

<p class='c005'>(1.) If there be an equiangular triangle not equilateral, it follows
that a whole can be found which is not greater than its part.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c027'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c005'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. This is the proposition in proof of which nearly the whole of the demonstration
of Euclid is spent.</p>
</div>

<p class='c005'>(2.) It is false that there can be any whole which is not greater than
its part (self evident).</p>

<p class='c005'>(3.) Therefore it is false that there is any equiangular triangle
which is not equilateral; or all equiangular triangles are equilateral.</p>

<p class='c005'>When a proposition is established by proving the truth of the matters
it contains, the demonstration is called <em>direct</em>; when by proving the
falsehood of every contradictory proposition, it is called <em>indirect</em>. The
latter species of demonstration is as logical as the former, but not of so
simple a kind; whence it is desirable to use the former whenever it can
be obtained.</p>

<p class='c005'>The use of indirect demonstration in the Elements of Euclid is almost
entirely confined to those propositions in which the converses of simple
propositions are proved. It frequently happens that an established
assertion of the form</p>

<p class='c005'>We have hitherto supposed that the premises are actually true;
and, in such a case, the logical conclusion is as certain as the premises.
It remains to say a few words upon the case in which the premises are
probably, but not certainly, true.</p>

<p class='c005'>The probability of an event being about to happen, and that of an
argument being true, may be so connected that the usual method of
measuring the first may be made to give an easy method of expressing
the second. Suppose an urn, or lottery, with a large number of balls,
black or white; then, if there be twelve white balls to one black, we say
it is twelve to one that a white ball will be drawn, or that a white ball
is twelve times as probable as a black one. A certain assertion may be

<p class='c005'>We have before explained that logic has nothing to do with the
truth or falsehood of assertions, but only professes, supposing them true,
to collect and classify the legitimate methods of drawing inferences.
Similarly, in this part of the subject, we do not trouble ourselves with
the question, How are we to find the probability due to premises? but
we ask: Supposing (happen how it may) that we <em>have</em> found the probability
of the premises, required the probability of the conclusion.
When the odds in favour of a conclusion are, say 6 to 1, there are, out
of every 7 possible chances, 6 in favour of the conclusion, and 1 against
it. Hence ⁶⁄₇ and ⅐ will represent the proportions, for and against, of

<p class='c005'>Let the probability of a conclusion, as derived from the premises (that
is on the supposition that it was never imagined to be possible till the
argument was heard), be called the <em>intrinsic probability</em> of the argument.
This is found by multiplying together the probabilities of all
the assertions which are necessary to the argument. Thus, suppose that
a conclusion was held to be impossible until an argument of a single syllogism
was produced, the premises of which have severally five to one and
eight to one in their favour. Then ⅚ × ⁸⁄₉, or ⁴⁰⁄₅₄, is the intrinsic probability
of the argument, and the odds in its favour are 40 to 14, or
20 to 7.</p>

<p class='c005'>But this intrinsic probability is not always that of the conclusion;
the latter, of course, depending in some degree on the likelihood which
the conclusion was supposed to have before the argument was produced.
A syllogism of 20 to 7 in its favour, advanced in favour of a conclusion
which was beforehand as likely as not, produces a much more probable
result than if the conclusion had been thought absolutely false until the
argument produced a certain belief in the possibility of its being true.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The change made in the probability of a conclusion by the introduction
of an argument (or of a new argument, if some have already
preceded) is found by the following rule.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the sum of the existing probability of the conclusion and the
intrinsic probability of the new argument, take their product; the remainder
is the probability of the conclusion, as reinforced by the argument.
Thus, <em>a + b − ab</em> is the probability of the truth of a conclusion
after the introduction of an argument of the intrinsic probability <em>b</em>, the
previous probability of the said conclusion having been <em>a</em>.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus, a conclusion which has at present the chance ⅔ in its favour,
when reinforced by an argument whose intrinsic probability is ¾, acquires
the probability ⅔ + ¾ − ⅔ × ¾ or, ⅔ + ¾ − ½, or ¹¹⁄₁₂; or, having
2 to 1 in its favour before, it has 11 to 1 in its favour after, the
argument.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the conclusion was neither likely nor unlikely beforehand
(or had the probability ½), the shortest way of applying the preceding
rule (in which <em>a + b − ab</em> becomes ½ + ½<em>b</em>) is to divide the sum of the
numerator and denominator of the intrinsic probability of the argument
by twice the denominator. Thus, an argument of which the intrinsic
probability is ¾, gives to a conclusion on which no bias previously
existed, the probability ⅞ or <span class='fraction'>3 + 4<br /><span class='vincula'>2 × 4</span></span>.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
